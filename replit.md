# RudeShare - Brutal Anonymous Social Media Platform

## Overview

RudeShare is a full-stack anonymous social media platform designed for brutal honesty and unfiltered opinions. Users can post anonymously without accounts, but politeness is automatically banned. The platform enforces rudeness through AI content moderation while still prohibiting death threats and harassment for legal compliance.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite for build tooling
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/UI components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

### Deployment Strategy
- **Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend to `dist/public`, esbuild bundles server
- **Production**: Serves static files from Express server
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR support

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Posts Table**: Stores post content with anonymous IDs, scores, timestamps, and media URLs
- **Votes Table**: Tracks upvotes/downvotes with IP-based deduplication
- **Reports Table**: Handles content moderation reports
- **IP Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 to prevent duplicate votes while maintaining anonymity
- **Media Support**: Image uploads only with 10MB file size limit

### Content Moderation & Privacy
- **No User Accounts**: Completely anonymous posting system
- **Automatic Politeness Detection**: AI system bans posts containing polite language
- **Legal Compliance**: Death threats and harassment still prohibited
- **IP-Based Deduplication**: Prevents spam while maintaining privacy through hashing
- **Anonymous Post IDs**: Generated unique identifiers like #A7B9C2 for each post

### API Structure
- `GET /api/posts?sort=newest|oldest|popular|controversial` - Retrieve all posts with sorting
- `GET /api/posts/search?q=query` - Search posts by content
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new anonymous post (with optional media)
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload images/videos (10MB/50MB limits)
- `POST /api/posts/:id/vote` - Vote on posts (up/down)
- `POST /api/posts/:id/report` - Report inappropriate content
- `POST /api/cleanup` - Manual cleanup of old posts
- `GET /api/statistics` - Platform usage statistics

### Frontend Components
- **Header**: Search functionality, navigation, and sorting controls
- **PostCard**: Individual post display with voting controls and media support
- **NewPostModal**: Post creation interface with file upload capabilities
- **GuidelinesModal**: Community guidelines display
- **Footer**: Platform information and links

## Data Flow

1. **Post Creation**: User submits content/media → File upload (if applicable) → Validation → Database storage → Anonymous ID generation
2. **Media Upload**: File selection → Size/type validation → Multer processing → File storage → URL generation
3. **Voting System**: User votes → IP hash check → Vote recording → Score update
4. **Content Moderation**: Report submission → Database logging → Automatic flagging at threshold
5. **Search & Sorting**: Query/sort processing → Database filtering → Results return with media
6. **Auto Cleanup**: Daily scheduled task removes posts >3 days old with no votes
